          <td class="bodyText"><p>As a Certified Financial Planner (TM) professional, I've helped people with financial questions since 1994. Helping people achieve their financial dreams has been very rewarding.</p>

		    <p>Early on, one of my biggest frustrations was seeing a couple wiped out financially by a nursing home stay. It didn't seem like there was a lot we could do. The attorneys simply said it was too late to do anything.</p>
		    <p>I did what I could for other couples. We did some planning and I encouraged them to protect themselves with long-term care insurance. Sometimes that wouldn't work. The couple may have already been too sick or too old in the insurance company's eyes. Then, the insurance company wants you to pay an arm and a leg.</p>
		    <p>Well, that simply didn't sound fair to me. These people had worked just as hard as anybody else to build their retirement nest egg, but the insurance company wouldn't help them protect their assets.</p>
		    <p>When one spouse is in a nursing home, the &quot;stay at home spouse&quot; is left trying to get by while writing big checks every month to a nursing home.</p>
		    <p>Many of these people have been looking for answers, but have been running up against a brick wall. Health and Human Services (the agency that provides government assistance) can't or won't show you how to properly preserve your money. It is not really their fault. They are simply too busy and aren't required to do so.</p>
		    <p>What can you do? Well, that was my question too. I didn't know where to start. I called every &quot;elder law&quot; attorney around, they didn't seem to know what to do either.</p>
		    <p>Then I began studying everything I could on how the government assistance programs (Medicaid) worked. I wrote letters to the state agencies that administer these programs. I wanted answers.</p>
	      <p>Most importantly, I've discovered there are ways to prevent all of your hard-earned money from going to a nursing home. Before you send another check to the nursing home, please give me a call for a free review of your situation. It is not too late to take action. Don't procrastinate any longer. Give us a call on our national toll-free number: 1-888-240-5579 or 1-402-727-4845.</p></td>
